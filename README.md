# Python-data-analysis-sample
A short sample code using common python libraries related to data analysis (such as pandas). This is intended merely to be an easily understood sample for potential employers and not a serious endeavor to study economics.

For those who want to simply see what the code and outputs look like there is an HTML file that should load in any browser labeled as "proj_3_v2.html". It can be viewed by opening the HTML file in a browser of choice. 

If one wishes to run the Python file "proj_3.py" or "proj_3_v3.ipynb" first download the repository here.

The easiest method to run either is through Anaconda found here https://www.anaconda.com simply choose the download for your operating system and install.


One can then use the Spyder IDE to run "proj_3.py" or Jupyter to run "proj_3_v3.ipynb" if one is using the GUI

One can also run "proj_3.py" via the command promp in Windows or Terminal in Linux or Ios systems using the Anaconda environment.

One can also run "proj_3.py" through the command prompt or Terminal provided that they have the matplotlib, numpy, pandas, sci-kit learn, scipy, and statsmodels libraries installed. 


All data is taken from the world bank and the IMF. 


Export quality and export diversity time series were taken from the IMF and can be found at the link below.
